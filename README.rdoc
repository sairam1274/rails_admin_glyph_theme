= Rails_Admin Theme by Glyph

Then add to your application Gemfile (before RailsAdmin):

```ruby
gem 'rails_admin_glyph_theme', git: 'git://github.com/vala/rails_admin_glyph_theme.git'
```
Inside your rails_admin application config/application.rb, just after Bundler.require:
```ruby
ENV['RAILS_ADMIN_THEME'] = 'glyph_theme'
```
This will allow for convenient live development testing.
